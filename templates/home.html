    <h1>A Python product</h1>
    <p>This website was built with Python via the Flask framework. It also contains
        <span class="css"> css [ cascade style sheets ] </span> and some
        <span class="js">Js [ Java scipting ]</span>.
        <br> Lately I will use bootstrap to handle some styling for me.
